<h3>Nature of poetry</h3>
<p>
<strong>Poetry</strong> can be differentiated most of the time from prose, which is language meant to convey 
meaning in a more expansive and less condensed way, frequently using more complete logical or 
narrative structures than poetry does. This does not necessarily imply that poetry is 
illogical, but rather that poetry is often created from the need to escape the logical, as well 
as expressing feelings and other expressions in a tight, condensed manner. English Romantic 
poet John Keats termed this escape from logic Negative Capability. A further complication is 
that prose poetry combines the characteristics of poetry with the superficial appearance of 
prose, such as in Robert Frost's poem, "Home Burial." Other forms include narrative poetry and 
dramatic poetry, both of which are used to tell stories and so resemble novels and plays. 
However, both these forms of poetry use the specific features of verse composition to make 
these stories more memorable or to enhance them in some way.
</p>
<p>
What is generally accepted as "great" poetry is debatable in many cases. "Great" poetry usually 
follows the characteristics listed above, but it is also set apart by its complexity and 
sophistication. "Great" poetry generally captures images vividly and in an original, refreshing 
way, while weaving together an intricate combination of elements like theme tension, complex 
emotion, and profound reflective thought. For examples of what is considered "great" poetry, 
visit the Pulitzer prize and Nobel prize sections for poetry.
</p>
<p>
The Greek verb <strong>&pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&omega;</strong> [poiéo (= I make or create)], 
gave rise to three words: <strong>&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</strong> [poiet?s 
(= the one who creates)], <strong>&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</strong> [poíesis 
(= the act of creation)] and <strong>&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</strong> [poíema (= the 
thing created)]. From these we get three English words: <strong>poet</strong> (the creator), <strong>poesy</strong> (the 
creation) and <strong>poem</strong> (the created). A poet is therefore one who creates and poetry is what the 
poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon. For example, in 
Anglo-Saxon a poet is a scop (shaper or maker) and in Scots makar.
</p>
 
<h3>Sound in poetry</h3>
<p>
Perhaps the most vital element of sound in poetry is rhythm. Often the rhythm of each line is 
arranged in a particular meter. Different types of meter played key roles in Classical, Early 
European, Eastern and Modern poetry. In the case of free verse, the rhythm of lines is often 
organized into looser units of cadence.
</p>
<p>
Poetry in English and other modern European languages often uses rhyme. Rhyme at the end of 
lines is the basis of a number of common poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming 
couplets. However, the use of rhyme is not universal. Much modern poetry, for example, avoids 
traditional rhyme schemes. Furthermore, Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. In 
fact, rhyme did not enter European poetry at all until the High Middle Ages, when it was 
adopted from the Arabic language. The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably 
in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil 
language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free 
grammar), which ensured a rhythm.
</p>
<p>
Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry 
(called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The 
alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry 
alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener 
expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and 
rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By 
contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical 
structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound 
structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call-
and-response performance.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the forms of rhyme, alliteration and rhythm that structure much poetry, sound 
plays a more subtle role in even free verse poetry in creating pleasing, varied patterns and 
emphasising or sometimes even illustrating semantic elements of the poem. Devices such as 
alliteration, assonance, consonance, dissonance and internal rhyme are among the ways poets use 
sound. Euphony refers to the musical, flowing quality of words arranged in an aesthetically 
pleasing way.
</p>

<h3>Poetry and form</h3>
<p>
Compared with prose, poetry depends less on the linguistic units of sentences and paragraphs, 
and more on units of organisation that are purely poetic. The typical structural elements are 
the line, couplet, strophe, stanza, and verse paragraph.
</p>
<p>
Lines may be self-contained units of sense, as in the well-known lines from William 
Shakespeare's Hamlet:
<blockquote>
To be, or not to be: that is the question. 
</blockquote>
Alternatively a line may end in mid-phrase or sentence:
<blockquote>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
</blockquote>
this linguistic unit is completed in the next line,
<blockquote>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. 
</blockquote>
This technique is called enjambment, and is used to create a sense of expectation in the reader 
and/or to add a dynamic to the movement of the verse.
</p>
<p>
In many instances, the effectiveness of a poem derives from the tension between the use of 
linguistic and formal units. With the advent of printing, poets gained greater control over the 
visual presentation of their work. As a result, the use of these formal elements, and of the 
white space they help create, became an important part of the poet's toolbox. Modernist poetry 
tends to take this to an extreme, with the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on 
the page forming an integral part of the poem's composition. In its most extreme form, this 
leads to the writing of concrete poetry.
</p>

<h3>Poetry and rhetoric</h3>
<p>
Rhetorical devices such as simile and metaphor are frequently used in poetry. Indeed, Aristotle 
wrote in his Poetics that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor". However, 
particularly since the rise of Modernism, some poets have opted for reduced use of these 
devices, preferring rather to attempt the direct presentation of things and experiences. Other 
20th-century poets, however, particularly the surrealists, have pushed rhetorical devices to 
their limits, making frequent use of catachresis.
</p>

<h3>History of poetry</h3>
<p>
Poetry as an art form predates literacy. In preliterate societies, poetry was frequently 
employed as a means of recording oral history, storytelling (epic poetry), genealogy, law and 
other forms of expression or knowledge that modern societies might expect to be handled in 
prose. The Ramayana, a Sanskrit epic which includes poetry, was probably written in the 3rd 
century BCE in a language described by William Jones as "more perfect than Latin, more copious 
than Greek and more exquisitely refined than either." Poetry is also often closely identified 
with liturgy in these societies, as the formal nature of poetry makes it easier to remember 
priestly incantations or prophecies. The greater part of the world's sacred scriptures are made 
up of poetry rather than prose.
</p>
<p>
The use of verse to transmit cultural information continues today. Many English 
speakingAmericans know that "in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue". An alphabet song 
teaches the names and order of the letters of the alphabet; another jingle states the lengths 
and names of the months in the Gregorian calendar. Preliterate societies, lacking the means to 
write down important cultural information, use similar methods to preserve it.
</p>
<p>
Some writers believe that poetry has its origins in song. Most of the characteristics that 
distinguish it from other forms of utterancerhythm, rhyme, compression, intensity of feeling, 
the use of refrainsappear to have come about from efforts to fit words to musical forms. 
However, in the European tradition the earliest surviving poems, the Homeric and Hesiodic 
epics, identify themselves as poems to be recited or chanted to a musical accompaniment rather 
than as pure song. Another interpretation, developed from 20th-century studies of living 
Montenegran epic reciters by Milman Parry and others, is that rhythm, refrains, and kennings 
are essentially paratactic devices that enable the reciter to reconstruct the poem from memory.
</p>
<p> 
In preliterate societies, all 
these forms of poetry were composed for, and sometimes during, performance. As such, there was 
a certain degree of fluidity to the exact wording of poems, given this could change from one 
performance or performer to another. The introduction of writing tended to fix the content of a 
poem to the version that happened to be written down and survive. Written composition also 
meant that poets began to compose not for an audience that was sitting in front of them but for 
an absent reader. Later, the invention of printing tended to accelerate these trends. Poets 
were now writing more for the eye than for the ear.
</p>
<p>
The development of literacy gave rise to more personal, shorter poems intended to be sung. 
These are called lyrics, which derives from the Greek lura or lyre, the instrument that was 
used to accompany the performance of Greek lyrics from about the seventh century BCE onward. 
The Greek's practice of singing hymns in large choruses gave rise in the sixth century BCE to 
dramatic verse, and to the practice of writing poetic plays for performance in their theatres.
</p>
<p>
In more recent times, the introduction of electronic media and the rise of the poetry reading 
have led to a resurgence of performance poetry and have resulted in a situation where poetry 
for the eye and poetry for the ear coexist, sometimes in the same poem. The late 20th-century 
rise of the singer-songwriter and Rap culture and the increase in popularity of Slam poetry 
have led to a renewed debate as to the nature of poetry that can be crudely characterised as a 
split between the academic and popular views. As of 2005, this debate is ongoing with no 
immediate prospect of a resolution.
</p>
<p>
Love poems proliferate now, in weblogs and personal pages, as a new way of expression and 
liberty of hearts, "I have won many female relations with this valid resource", has said a 
contemporaneus writer called Federic P. Sabeloteur.
